A Fork of Chart.js
======
This is a fork of Chart.js where I took a few hours to implement some proof of concept events and interactivity into the otherwise static canvas-based Chart.js library.

Instead of using DOM-based events, it registers shapes and when the mouse moves, it checks to see if the mouse position falls in the shape to trigger a callback. 

See [the Chart.js docs on interactivity](http://www.chartjs.org/docs/#generalIssues-chartInteractivity) for info on why this isn't included by default in Chart.js.
